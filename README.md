# Start a Release on a remote CloudBees CD/RO instance
## Description
This is one of several GitHub Actions provided on an "as-is" basis by CloudBees that enable users to write GitHub Action Workflows that send work to an external CloudBees CD/RO instance. This Action enables workflows to start an existing Release on a remote CloudBees CD/RO instance.
## Intended audience
For teams utilizing GitHub Actions for build and continuous integration, the CloudBees CD/RO Actions provide a mechanism for releasing software securely, governed, and auditable with deep visibility as is required in regulated industries, for example. Platform or shared services teams can build reusable content in the CloudBees CD/RO platform that conforms to company standards and removes the burden of release automation from the application teams.
## Prerequisites
CloudBees CD/RO is an enterprise "on-premise" product that automate software delivery processes, including production deployments and releases. To use utilize this GitHub Action, it is necessary to have access to a CloudBees CD/RO instance, in particular: 
* A CloudBees CD/RO instance that GitHub Actions can access through REST calls (TCP port 443)
* A valid API token for the CloudBees CD/RO instance. A token can be generated from the _Access Token_ link on the user profile page of the CloudBees CD/RO user interface; see [Manage access tokens via the UI](https://docs.beescloud.com/docs/cloudbees-cd/latest/intro/sign-in-cd#_manage_access_tokens_via_the_ui) documentation for details.
These values should be stored as GitHub Action secrets to be referenced securely in a GitHub Actions workflow.
## Usage
The CloudBees CD/RO GitHub Actions are called from _steps_ in a GitHub Actions _workflow_. The following workflow extract illustrates how to start an existing Release on a remote CloudBees CD/RO instance, including _actual parameters_.
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Start Release Action
    uses: cloudbees-actions/start-release@main
    env:
      CDRO_URL: ${{ secrets.CDRO_URL }}
      CDRO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CDRO_TOKEN }}
    with:
      projectName: My project
      releaseName: My release
      pipelineParameter: |
        param1: param1 value
        param2: 1.0
```
### Inputs
| Name                   | Description                                                            | Required |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| projectName            | Project name of the release                                            | yes      |
| releaseName            | Release name                                                           | yes      |
| pipelineParameter      | Parameters as list of key-value pairs                                  | no       |
| ignore-unverified-cert | Ignore unverified SSL certificate                                      | no       |
### Secrets and Variables
The following GitHub secrets are needed to start the Action. These can be set in the _Secrets and variable_ section of the workflow repository _Settings_ tab.
| Name                   | Description                                                            | Required |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| CDRO_URL               | CloudBees CD/RO server URL, e.g., `https://my-cdro.net` or `https://74.125.134.147` | yes |
| CDRO_TOKEN             | CloudBees CD/RO API Access token                                       | yes      |
## Examples
### Create and start a Release
1. Set up secrets in the repository settings for Actions. In the GitHub repository, select the _Settings_ tab, then _Secrets and variables_, then _Actions_. Use the _New Repository_ button to create the CDRO_URL and CDRO_TOKEN secrets.
2. Create a DSL file in the root directory of your repository, for example, `simple-release-dsl.groovy`:
```groovy
project "Default",{
	release "My simple release", {
		pipeline "GHA release pipeline",{
			formalParameter "Input1"
			formalParameter "Input2"
			formalParameter "Input3", type: "textarea"
		stage "QA"
		stage "Production"
		}
	}
}
```
3. Create a new workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory, for example, `simple-release.yml`:
```yaml
name: Create and start release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  create-and-start-release:
    starts-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CDRO_URL: ${{ secrets.CDRO_URL }}
      CDRO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CDRO_TOKEN }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Create release
        uses: cloudbees-actions/eval-dsl@main
        with:
          dsl-file: simple-release-dsl.groovy

      - name: start release
        uses: cloudbees-actions/start-release@main
        with:
          projectName: Default
          releaseName: My simple release
          actualParameter: |
            Input1: 123
            Input1: abc
            Input1: xyz
```
4. Go to the GitHub `Actions` tab and start the workflow `Create and start release`
